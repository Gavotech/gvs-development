**GitHub** is an **online platform where people store, manage, and work together on code**.

Think of it like **Google Drive for coding**, but with tools for **version control and teamwork**.

---

## In simple words

GitHub helps you:

* 📦 **Save your code online**
* 🕒 **Track changes** (who changed what and when)
* 🤝 **Work with others on the same project**
* 🔄 **Go back to older versions if something breaks**

---

## How GitHub works (basic idea)

GitHub is built on **Git**, which is a version control system.

* **Git** → tracks code changes on your computer
* **GitHub** → stores those Git projects online

---

## Example

Imagine you’re building a website:

* You write code on your laptop
* GitHub keeps a copy online
* Your friend edits the same project
* GitHub merges both changes safely

---

## Main things in GitHub

* **Repository (repo)** → a project folder
* **Commit** → a saved change
* **Branch** → a separate version of the project
* **Pull Request (PR)** → ask to merge changes
* **Issues** → report bugs or request features

---

## Why people use GitHub

* 💻 Backup code safely
* 👥 Team collaboration
* 📚 Learn from open-source projects
* 🚀 Show projects to employers
* 🔧 Manage large software projects

## Who uses GitHub

* Students 👨‍🎓
* Developers 👩‍💻
